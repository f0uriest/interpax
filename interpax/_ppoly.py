    ----------
    c : ndarray, shape (k, m, ...)
        Polynomial coefficients, order `k` and `m` intervals.
    x : ndarray, shape (m+1,)
        Polynomial breakpoints. Must be sorted in either increasing or

    extrapolate : bool or 'periodic', optional
        If bool, determines whether to extrapolate to out-of-bounds points

    High-order polynomials in the power basis can be numerically

class PchipInterpolator(CubicHermiteSpline):
    r"""PCHIP 1-D monotonic cubic interpolation.

    ``x`` and ``y`` are arrays of values used to approximate some function f,
    with ``y = f(x)``. The interpolant uses monotonic cubic splines
    to find the value of new points. (PCHIP stands for Piecewise Cubic
    Hermite Interpolating Polynomial).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray, shape (npoints, )
        A 1-D array of monotonically increasing real values. ``x`` cannot
        include duplicate values (otherwise f is overspecified)
    y : ndarray, shape (..., npoints, ...)
        A N-D array of real values. ``y``'s length along the interpolation
        axis must be equal to the length of ``x``. Use the ``axis``
        parameter to select the interpolation axis.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis in the ``y`` array corresponding to the x-coordinate values. Defaults
        to ``axis=0``.
    extrapolate : bool, optional
        Whether to extrapolate to out-of-bounds points based on first
        and last intervals, or to return NaNs.
    check : bool
        Whether to perform checks on the input. Should be False if used under JIT.

    Notes
    -----
    The interpolator preserves monotonicity in the interpolation data and does
    not overshoot if the data is not smooth.

    The first derivatives are guaranteed to be continuous, but the second
    derivatives may jump at :math:`x_k`.

    Determines the derivatives at the points :math:`x_k`, :math:`f'_k`,
    by using PCHIP algorithm [1]_.

    Let :math:`h_k = x_{k+1} - x_k`, and  :math:`d_k = (y_{k+1} - y_k) / h_k`
    are the slopes at internal points :math:`x_k`.
    If the signs of :math:`d_k` and :math:`d_{k-1}` are different or either of
    them equals zero, then :math:`f'_k = 0`. Otherwise, it is given by the
    weighted harmonic mean

    .. math::

        \frac{w_1 + w_2}{f'_k} = \frac{w_1}{d_{k-1}} + \frac{w_2}{d_k}

    where :math:`w_1 = 2 h_k + h_{k-1}` and :math:`w_2 = h_k + 2 h_{k-1}`.

    The end slopes are set using a one-sided scheme [2]_.

class CubicSpline(CubicHermiteSpline):
    """Cubic spline data interpolator.

    Interpolate data with a piecewise cubic polynomial which is twice
    continuously differentiable [1]_. The result is represented as a `PPoly`
    instance with breakpoints matching the given data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (n,)
        1-D array containing values of the independent variable.
        Values must be real, finite and in strictly increasing order.
    y : array_like
        Array containing values of the dependent variable. It can have
        arbitrary number of dimensions, but the length along ``axis``
        (see below) must match the length of ``x``. Values must be finite.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which `y` is assumed to be varying. Meaning that for
        ``x[i]`` the corresponding values are ``np.take(y, i, axis=axis)``.
        Default is 0.
    bc_type : string or 2-tuple, optional
        Boundary condition type. Two additional equations, given by the
        boundary conditions, are required to determine all coefficients of
        polynomials on each segment [2]_.

        If `bc_type` is a string, then the specified condition will be applied
        at both ends of a spline. Available conditions are:

        * 'not-a-knot' (default): The first and second segment at a curve end
          are the same polynomial. It is a good default when there is no
          information on boundary conditions.
        * 'periodic': The interpolated functions is assumed to be periodic
          of period ``x[-1] - x[0]``. The first and last value of `y` must be
          identical: ``y[0] == y[-1]``. This boundary condition will result in
          ``y'[0] == y'[-1]`` and ``y''[0] == y''[-1]``.
        * 'clamped': The first derivative at curves ends are zero. Assuming
          a 1D `y`, ``bc_type=((1, 0.0), (1, 0.0))`` is the same condition.
        * 'natural': The second derivative at curve ends are zero. Assuming
          a 1D `y`, ``bc_type=((2, 0.0), (2, 0.0))`` is the same condition.

        If `bc_type` is a 2-tuple, the first and the second value will be
        applied at the curve start and end respectively. The tuple values can
        be one of the previously mentioned strings (except 'periodic') or a
        tuple `(order, deriv_values)` allowing to specify arbitrary
        derivatives at curve ends:

        * `order`: the derivative order, 1 or 2.
        * `deriv_value`: array_like containing derivative values, shape must
          be the same as `y`, excluding ``axis`` dimension. For example, if
          `y` is 1-D, then `deriv_value` must be a scalar. If `y` is 3-D with
          the shape (n0, n1, n2) and axis=2, then `deriv_value` must be 2-D
          and have the shape (n0, n1).
    extrapolate : {bool, 'periodic', None}, optional
        If bool, determines whether to extrapolate to out-of-bounds points
        based on first and last intervals, or to return NaNs. If 'periodic',
        periodic extrapolation is used. If None (default), ``extrapolate`` is
        set to 'periodic' for ``bc_type='periodic'`` and to True otherwise.
    check : bool
        Whether to perform checks on the input. Should be False if used under JIT.

    PchipInterpolator : PCHIP 1-D monotonic cubic interpolator.
    PPoly : Piecewise polynomial in terms of coefficients and breakpoints.

    Notes
    -----
    Parameters `bc_type` and ``extrapolate`` work independently, i.e. the
    former controls only construction of a spline, and the latter only
    evaluation.

    When a boundary condition is 'not-a-knot' and n = 2, it is replaced by
    a condition that the first derivative is equal to the linear interpolant
    slope. When both boundary conditions are 'not-a-knot' and n = 3, the
    solution is sought as a parabola passing through given points.
